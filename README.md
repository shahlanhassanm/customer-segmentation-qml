# Customer Segmentation Using QML

## Overview
This project explores customer segmentation techniques using QML (Qt Modeling Language) for data visualization and analysis. The primary goal is to provide insights into customer behavior, enabling businesses to enhance their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Objectives
- **Segment Customers:** Utilize various clustering algorithms to categorize customers based on purchasing behavior.
- **Data Visualization:** Leverage QML to create interactive visualizations that facilitate understanding of customer segments.
- **Insights Generation:** Analyze segments to derive actionable insights for targeted marketing and personalized services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Qt SDK:** Follow the [QML Installation Guide](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/gettingstartedqt.html) to install the Qt development environment.
- **Python Packages:** Install necessary Python packages (if applicable):
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

Methodologies
The project employs several methodologies for customer segmentation, including:

K-means Clustering: A popular method for partitioning customers into distinct groups based on their features.
Hierarchical Clustering: An approach to build a hierarchy of clusters.
DBSCAN: A density-based clustering algorithm that identifies clusters of varying shapes.
Refer to the /docs/methodologies.md file for detailed explanations of these techniques.

Data Sources
The primary dataset used in this project is Mall_Customers.csv, which includes customer demographics and spending behavior. More information about the data and preprocessing steps can be found in the /docs/data_sources.md file.

Visualization Techniques
QML is used for creating interactive visualizations. Various charts and graphs are implemented to showcase customer segments. For specific visualization methods used, refer to /docs/visualization_techniques.md.
